### a quest

Light, oppressive through your eyelids as you  
come back to your  
senses, your frozen limbs that that lack the will to  
breach the walls,  
these empty walls.

Outside, the rain falls fresh,  
unreachable.  
Outside, she waits for  
repetitions of endless days.

Unable to recognise  
the path that you left behind

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once here,  
you peer through the glass,  
failing to see.

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
You are waiting, standing  
above it, afraid to look down

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once in,  
you peer through the cracks,  
failing to see.

Face it,  
open your eyes and see  
that's all the same again  
inside this

whiteness, now,  
blinding, now,  
numbness, now,  
silence.  

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
Striving for a chance to  
become what you've lost and   
hold on, hold on tight  
descending from these heights to  
wake up, now,  
larger, now,  
break free.



### a soliloquy

Stay away,  
watch it all unfold  
from behind the veil.  
And watch them play,  
watch them love and laugh,  
a wistful touch,  
this one you crave.

See their faces cast a slower light,  
a distorted scene.  

And as you start to wane,  
hovering,  
just listen to the sounds  
they cannot hear,  
washing over you,  
wiping out the view,  
erasing.

From within, a doorway to step through, unnoticed,  
to slowly recede  

and disappear into the other side,  
to leave untouched.
