I'm a post-doctoral fellow in the [Systems Medicine of Infectious Diseases (SMID)](http://systemsmedicine.de/) group at the [Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS)](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/).

My research interests can be broadly described as interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics. From a theoretical point of view, I'm particularly interested in macroscopic phenomena emerging from simple, microscopic rules---eg., chaos, pattern formation, self-organisation---and the role played by stochasticity both in inducing and in interacting with these.

Currently, I'm working on the within-host modelling of infectious disease dynamics, and its implications for vaccination and between-host behaviour.

I'm also a wannabe musician, and I'm currently looking for a keyboardist to finish and record an album. The closest influences I can think of are Michał Łapaj from Riverside, Diego Tejeida from Haken and Joakim Svalberg from Opeth. Below, you can listen to a short instrumental teaser. I'm on guitar and have already found actual human beings to record the bass and drums. If you happen to fit the profile, or know someone who does, please get in touch!
