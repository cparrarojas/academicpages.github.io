### a quest

Light, oppressive through your eyelids as you  
come back to your  
senses, your frozen limbs that that lack the will to  
breach the walls,  
these empty walls.

Outside, the rain falls fresh,  
unreachable.  
Outside, she waits for  
repetitions of endless days.

Unable to recognise  
the path that you left behind

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once here,  
you peer through the glass  
failing to see.

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
You are waiting, standing  
above it, afraid to look down...

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once in,  
you peer through the cracks  
failing to see.

Face it,  
open your eyes and see  
that's all the same again  
inside this

whiteness, now,  
blinding, now,  
numbness, now,  
silence.  

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
Striving for a chance to  
become what you've lost and   
hold on, hold on tight  
descending from these heights to  
wake up, now,  
larger, now,  
break free.



### a delusion

Come, stare at a world that was created  
just for you,  
this soil, precious, fertile, these hands to  
guide you through.  
So many ways to follow this, so many ways to  
thrive,  
anticipating to discover no limits within your  
mind.

Go, walk away  
with eyes open wide  
towards the sunshine   
to find your way.

See what you believe to make you unique  
reflecting back at you  
from faces around, the same to be found,  
now barren, broken through.

Go, walk away  
with eyes open wide  
towards the sunshine   
to find your way.

Devoid of the thrill, experience defeat  
and triumph, painless, mild.  
Struck by the bitter realisation of  
commitment slipping by.

Inconsequential, passionless, you wallow in   
stagnant waters of promises unfulfilled.  
But, you see...

A lack of agency to stop the flow, to quit  
this apathetic march you sabotage to care.  
Well, you know,  
your answer is not there.

All you covet remains indifferent  
to the vapid demise of your petty self.  
Weary, you scratch the walls to try again.  
Too late, it always has been just too late  
to become someone else.



### a return

A thinning rope, this fabric torn  
through fingers that miss the ground.  
Flailing, I strain to heed  
the nebulous calls of melting  
faces, falling apart,  
stretching, reaching from afar.

Yearning for visions now forgotten,  
failing to connect  
the pieces that are left,    
to retrace the steps now  
fading.

Navigate this fragility  
to recall a faint  
memory of tranquillity,  
interrupted.

Wishing for tomorrow to reveal...

Thrust into the future of this past,  
its broken roots and forsaken lands,  
to face, again, equilibrium, self,  
dislocating.

Wishing for tomorrow to reveal    
what lies beyond  
this fragmented shore.  
A new horizon  
to behold.

Drifting away  
this time as before,  
aching to regain  
this time I let go.

And I'm still here,  
wishing for tomorrow to reveal

somewhere to belong,  
something to cling to  
for just a minute.

Wait here  
for all these years to bring the tides to  
clear, and sweep away the fear.  
Probing the sands, in darkness I hunt for a  
sense of direction. And scrambling, off-balance,  
I'm wandering.



### a soliloquy

Stay away,  
watch it all unfold  
from behind the veil.  
And watch them play,  
watch them love and laugh,  
a wistful touch,  
this one you crave.

See their faces cast a slower light,  
a distorted scene.  

And as you start to wane,  
hovering,  
just listen to the sounds  
they cannot hear,  
washing over you,  
wiping out the view,  
erasing.

From within, a doorway to step through, unnoticed,  
to slowly recede  

and disappear into the other side,  
to leave untouched.
