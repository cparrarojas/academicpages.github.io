### a quest

Light, oppressive through your eyelids as you  
come back to your  
senses, your frozen limbs that that lack the will to  
breach the walls,  
these empty walls.

Outside, the rain falls fresh,  
unreachable.  
Outside, she waits for  
repetitions of endless days.

Unable to recognise  
the path that you left behind

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once here,  
you peer through the glass  
failing to see.

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
You are waiting, standing  
above it, afraid to look down...

and uncover the tracks  
of what was once in,  
you peer through the cracks  
failing to see.

Face it,  
open your eyes and see  
that's all the same again  
inside this

whiteness, now,  
blinding, now,  
numbness, now,  
silence.  

A featureless place to lie  
still as the hours pass you by.  
Striving for a chance to  
become what you've lost and   
hold on, hold on tight  
descending from these heights to  
wake up, now,  
larger, now,  
break free.



### a congregation

Come in as a stranger, stay at a  
distance to observe and learn their traits.  
Restructuring patterns, accommodate to  
fill the gaps and take your place.

Then when they look away you put on another face,  
a fleeting glimpse of your presence disconnecting, dissociating.

Feel it run through your hands, a thread of lies.  
Try now to meet their eyes, affect a smile  
to make them forget.

Ceaseless masquerading, in hiding you've got  
one for many, one for none,  
coalescing, shapeless, a multitude of  
eyes turning inwards to gaze upon the core.

Recoil  
as they see through you.

A fleeting glimpse of your presence disconnecting, dissociating.

Feel it run through your hands, a thread of lies.  
Try now to meet their eyes, affect a smile  
to make them forget.

Sever these connections to face  
further revelation.



### a deception

Immaterial, I dwell in darkness,  
just an echo of these past selves without you.  
A shimmer on the surface is all I have to give  
when I open, presenting, for you to fill, this

empty vase,  
a room of mirrors to make you feel safe.  
All around you, now,  
the walls are closing in.  
By your hands  
you bring me forth into existence.  
As you vanish, I become  
before your draining eyes.

Pervading,  
I occupy.

### a delusion

Come, stare at a world that was created  
just for you,  
this soil, precious, fertile, these hands to  
guide you through.  
So many ways to follow this, so many ways to  
thrive,  
anticipating to discover no limits within your  
mind.

Go, walk away  
with eyes open wide  
towards the sunshine   
to find your way.

See what you believe to make you unique  
reflecting back at you  
from faces around, the same to be found,  
now barren, broken through.

Go, walk away  
with eyes open wide  
towards the sunshine   
to find your way.

Devoid of the thrill, experience defeat  
and triumph, painless, mild.  
Struck by the bitter realisation of  
commitment slipping by.

Inconsequential, passionless, you wallow in   
stagnant waters of promises unfulfilled.  
But, you see...

A lack of agency to stop the flow, to quit  
this apathetic march you sabotage to care.  
Well, you know,  
your answer is not there.

All you covet remains indifferent  
to the vapid demise of your petty self.  
Weary, you scratch the walls to try again.  
Too late, it always has been just too late  
to become someone else.



### a chasm

Revisit the places we were,  
trying not to forget.  
Acknowledge it doesn't make sense  
to bring back the  
days from before.  
Acknowledge the loss.

The silence that we shared,  
now just lost words in others.  
Reaching out, diverge,  
we pass through one another.  

Reconnecting incongruous paths  
with nothing to say,  
a futile recollection of moments  
when we were the same.  

Find the language to tell the  
story we left to rot,  
in blindness of proximity we were  
unwilling to grow.

Among the many faces I look through,  
you rise up to present this new old you,  
confronting me, expecting more,  
unaware that it's no one's fault:  
we got here together.

Among the many faces I look through,  
you rise up to present this new old you,  
confronting me, expecting more,  
unaware that it's no one's fault:  
we got here together.  

How come we got here...

Together we embraced inaction,  
setting up a barrier of static, a wraith.  
Wake me now, engage, elicit a reaction,  
then again repeat the same till I don't care.



### a beacon

With every step,  
as less than one we fade,  
and I learn you whole  
as I offer you all  
I am today.

But, when I'm looking straight in your eyes,  
I start to realise  
how much reflects outside, how distant  
I must seem to you.

You see, if I strip myself away,  
a little detachment is okay.  
Imagine that there is a way through  
and I'll be there with you.

So let me be bare and frail, let me fail,  
leave all these layers behind myself  
to fall together  
in place.

You see, if I strip myself away,  
a little detachment is okay.  
Imagine that there is a way through  
and I'll be the one to follow.  
So, when the doors are open,  
remember to leave a trace  
to find you.

In you I conceal myself when I'm  
weak and scared I'll disappoint you.  
Disoriented, feigning strength as I  
stand before you, desperate, broken  
when I'm left here to go,  
in absence, through it all,    
the rituals we perform.

Take this moment, a lifetime  
to build and keep this  
fragile balance, to cherish  
this routine. I pledge to  
be your shelter again,  
another day.  
Please, stay.



### a return

A thinning rope, this fabric torn  
through fingers that miss the ground.  
Flailing, I strain to heed  
the nebulous calls of melting  
faces, falling apart,  
stretching, reaching from afar.

Yearning for visions now forgotten,  
failing to collect  
the pieces that are left,    
to retrace the steps now  
fading.

Navigate this fragility  
to recall a faint  
memory of tranquillity,  
interrupted.

Wishing for tomorrow to reveal...

Thrust into the future of this past,  
its broken roots and forsaken lands,  
to face, again, equilibrium, self,  
dislocating.

Wishing for tomorrow to reveal    
what lies beyond  
this fragmented shore.  
A new horizon  
to behold.

Drifting away  
this time as before,  
aching to regain  
this time I let go.

And I'm still here,  
wishing for tomorrow to reveal

somewhere to belong,  
something to cling to  
for just a minute.

Wait here  
for all these years to bring the tides to  
clear, and sweep away the fear.  
Probing the sands, in darkness I hunt for a  
sense of direction. And scrambling, off-balance,  
I'm wandering.



### a soliloquy

Stay away,  
watch it all unfold  
from behind the veil.  
And watch them play,  
watch them love and laugh,  
a wistful touch,  
this one you crave.

See their faces cast a slower light,  
a distorted scene.  

And as you start to wane,  
hovering,  
just listen to the sounds  
they cannot hear,  
taking hold of you,  
wiping out the view,  
erasing.

From within, a doorway to step through, unnoticed,  
to slowly recede  

and disappear into the other side,  
to leave untouched.
