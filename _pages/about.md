I am a post-doctoral fellow in the [Systems Medicine of Infectious Diseases (SMID)](http://systemsmedicine.de/) group at the [Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS)](https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/).

My research interests can be broadly described as interdisciplinary applications of statistical physics. From a theoretical point of view, I am particularly interested in macroscopic phenomena emerging from simple, microscopic rules---eg., chaos, pattern formation, self-organisation---and the role played by stochasticity both in inducing and in interacting with these.

Currently, I am working on the within-host modelling of infectious disease dynamics, and its implications for vaccination and between-host behaviour.
